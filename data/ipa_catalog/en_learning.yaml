    title: "What is IPA?"
    description: "The International Phonetic Alphabet is a system to represent speech sounds precisely."
    content: |
      IPA uses unique symbols for each sound, unlike regular spelling.
      For example, 'th' in English represents TWO different sounds:
      - /θ/ as in 'think' (voiceless)
      - /ð/ as in 'this' (voiced)
      
      Learning IPA helps you:
      1. Understand exactly what sound to make
      2. Identify your pronunciation errors
      3. Learn any language more efficiently

  - id: "consonants-basics"
    title: "Consonants: Place & Manner"
    content: |
      Consonants are described by:
      - PLACE: Where in your mouth (lips, teeth, tongue position)
      - MANNER: How air flows (stopped, continuous, etc.)
      - VOICING: Whether vocal cords vibrate

  - id: "vowels-basics"
    title: "Vowels: The Vowel Space"
    content: |
